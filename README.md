# Imagine Dragons Website
This website that I have created is for the band called "Imagine Dragons".

# Design Process
As a fan of the band, I would like to find out more about the tour that the band is going to have to see if I am free to go for the concert, so I would want a webpage where I can find out the tour details, such as where it is being held and at what time so that I know if I can make it to the concert and if I can, I would like to buy tickets to their show. As a fan of the band, I want to have a page where I can see all the merch that the band is selling so that I would not have a hard time finding the merch that I am interested in and buying them. I would also hope that I can purchase the band's merch directly through their website so that I can gurantee its authenticity and can save time to just buy from the official website instead of buying from a reseller. As a user, I want to have a webpage where I can learn more about the band and its band members, such as when the band was founded, when and how the band members came together and a brief description of the band members, such as how they joined the band and what were their lives like before they joined the band. As a fan, I want to see the band's social media, to keep in touch with important announcements such as when they will be releasing new songs or when they will be releasing their tour dates. Last but not least, as a user, I want a webpage where I can see all the albums the band has released to date so that I know what songs to search for if I want to listen to those songs.

# Features
    # Existing features (clickable)
    -> Social media buttons (at the top of the website) - allows fans of the band to check out the band's social media for any important announcements such as tour dates by clicking on any of the respective social media buttons
    -> Tour (at the middle of the webpage) - allows fans to find out more information about the tour if the band is having one, such as the date and location of the tour, so that they can see if they can make it to the tour and buy their tickets through the website directly if they are able to make it.

    # Features left to implement (buttons there but not clickable yet)
    -> Music button (at the middle of the webpage) - allows fans to check out all the albums that the band has released to date so that they can check out all the music that the band has made to date
    -> Merch button (at the middle of the webpage) - allows fans to look at all the merch that the band is selling so that they can choose which merch they would like to buy and buy them through the website
    -> Profile (at the middle of the webpage) - allows users to find out more about the band such as when and how they came together and also a brief description of the band members such as how they joined the band and what their lives were like before they joined

# Technologies used
So far, only HTML and CSS are being used. HTML is being used for the layout of the page and CSS is being used to style the page (i.e. add colour, change colour, make buttons hover, etc.).

# Testing
To date, only the social media and merch buttons are working. The rest of the buttons do not bring the user to anywhere at the moment and also havent used media query to adjust the screen to make the page look like the way I want it to look on mobile. Everything is only catered to the desktop version for now and there are no bugs at the moment.
