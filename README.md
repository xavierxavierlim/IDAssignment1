# Imagine Dragons Website
This website that I have created is for the band called "Imagine Dragons".

# Design Process
As a fan of the band, I would like to find out more about the tour that the band is going to have to see if I am free to go for the concert, so I would want a webpage where I can find out the tour details, such as where it is being held and at what time so that I know if I can make it to the concert and if I can, I would like to buy tickets to their show. As a fan of the band, I want to have a page where I can see all the merch that the band is selling so that I would not have a hard time finding the merch that I am interested in and buying them. I would also hope that I can purchase the band's merch directly through their website so that I can gurantee its authenticity and can save time to just buy from the official website instead of buying from a reseller. As a user, I want to have a webpage where I can learn more about the band and its band members, such as when the band was founded, when and how the band members came together and a brief description of the band members, such as how they joined the band and what were their lives like before they joined the band. As a fan, I want to see the band's social media, to keep in touch with important announcements such as when they will be releasing new songs or when they will be releasing their tour dates. Last but not least, as a user, I want a webpage where I can see all the albums the band has released to date so that I know what songs to search for if I want to listen to those songs.

# Features
    # Features
    - Profile, tour, music, merch and home buttons (only four at one page depending on which page the user is looking at) are being added to the top of the page so that users can navigate to these pages without having to scroll down. The social media icons are being added at the bottom of every page so that users do not have to head to the main page to check out the band's social media and can view it from anywhere in the webpage.

    - In the main page, there is a banner for the albums for users to check out the latest albums released by Imagine Dragons and a button to click that brings them to the music page where they can check out all the music released by Imagine Dragons. Additionally, there is a banner for the tour page that showcases some pictures of the band performing live to allow users to click on the "FIND OUT MORE" button to check out tour information. There is also a profile banner that showcases a few group pictures the ban has taken together and users can click on the "LEARN MORE" button that allows them to find out more information about the band and its members.

    - In the tour page, users can see pictures and a video of Imagine Dragons performing live on tour. There are two different tables, upcoming tours for the tours that are coming soon and future tours for the tours that are coming later. Users can click on the date which will bring them to a website where they can purchase tickets and if they click on the location, they will be able to see exactly where the tour location is on Google Maps.

    - In the profile page, users can learn more about the band and all of its members by looking at a slideshow which contains information (i.e. history, awards, career) about the band and all of its members.

    - In the music page, users can learn more about the all albums that Imagine Dragons has released to date with a brief description about each album and its release date. The albums in the page contains songs that users can listen to by clicking on whichever song they are interested to listen to. Users can listen to the full version to any song they want as long as they log in to their spotify.



# Technologies used
HTML, CSS and Javascript are being used in this assignment. HTML is being used for the layout of the page and CSS is being used to style the page (i.e. add colour, change colur, make buttons hover, etc.). Javascript is being used for the slideshow in the profile.html file.

# Testing
The buttons in all the pages are functioning properly. At the top, there are four buttons (profile, merch, tour, home and music depending on where the current page is) and it all brings the user to the respective pages. At the very bottom of the page, the social media icons are clickable and it will bring users to the respective social media platforms when clicked. For example, if the user wants to see the tour dates and location from the home page, they can either click the tour button from the top of the screen or scroll down and click the "FIND OUT MORE" button under the tour section. If they want to check out the albums that the band has released, they can click on either the music button at the top of the screen or scroll down and click "LISTEN NOW" at the albums section. If they would like to go back to the home page from one of the other pages, they can click on the "HOME" button from whichever page they are at Having these buttons allows users to navigate through the page smoothly. I have also passed all the codes into the validator and have fixed all the issues that have arised from it except the music page and the tour page where they gave errors regarding the frameborder when I embedded Spotify and Youtube links on my music and tour page.
