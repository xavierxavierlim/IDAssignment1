        Origins is the fourth studio album by the American pop rock band Imagine Dragons, released 
        by Kidinakorner, Polydor Records and Interscope Records. The album was produced by the 
        band members themselves, frequent collaborator Alex da Kid, Mattman & Robin, John Hill, Joel

        album" to Evolve, and that it would complete a cycle of their music.

        Evolve (stylized as ƎVOLVE) is the third studio album by American pop rock band Imagine Dragons, 
        released by Kidinakorner and Interscope Records. After the release of their previous album 
        Smoke + Mirrors (2015) and its respective world tour, a self-imposed hiatus for 2016 and cryptic 
        messages from the band through their social media gained anticipation for their third album; it 
        was finally announced on May 9, 2017, along with the initiation of its pre-order. In comparison 
        to Smoke + Mirrors and their 2012 debut Night Visions, frontman Dan Reynolds called the album an 
        "evolution" for the band.
