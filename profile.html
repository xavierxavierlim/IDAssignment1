                <h3 style="text-align: center">History</h3>
                In 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brightman Young University 
                and both of them went on to recruit Andrew Beck to play the guitar, Dave Lemke to play the 
                bass and Aurora Florence to play the piano and the initial band name was Anagram. They 
                released an extended play called "Speak to me" that year but Beck and Florence left the band 
                later that year. In 2009, Tolman recruited his friend Wayne Sermon to play the guitar and later 
                on recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman to sing back-up and play keys and they began to play shows 
                again. Lemke left the band later on, which led Sermon to recruit his friend Ben McKee to play the
                bass. The band had a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before they moved to Las
                Vegas, where they recorded and released their first three EPs, "Imagine Dragons" on September 1, 
                2009, "Hell and Silence" on March 10, 2010 and "It's Time" on November 18, 2011. Six months after 
                they released their third EP, they signed a record deal with Interscope Records on November 18 2011. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                They got their first big break when Train's fontman Pat Monahan fell sick just before the Bite of Las 
                Vegas Festival 2009 leading to Imagine Dragons being called in to perform to more than 26 000 people. 
                Local accolades such as "Best CD of 2011", "Best Local Indie Band 2010" and more sent them on a positive 
                trajectory and led them to sign with Interscope Records and begin working with English Grammy Award-winning
                producer Alex da Kid. Eventually, the Tolmans left the group, drummer Daniel Platzman and keyboardist
                Theresa Flaminio (who later left in early 2012) were recruited by Ben McKee in August 2011, prior to 
                the band's label deal in November 2011. Together, the 4-man band made two EPs, Continued Silence and 
                Hear Me before releasing albums.

                <h3 style="text-align: center">Albums</h3>
                The band first gained exposure with the release of their single "It's Time", before dropping their 
                award-winning debut studio album "Night Visions", which resulted in chart-topping singles 
                "Radioactive" and "Demons". Their second studio album "Smoke + Mirrors" in 2015 reached No.1 in US, 
                Canada and the UK. This was followed by their third album "Evolve" in 2017, which resulted in three
                chart-topping singles, "Believer", "Thunder" and "Whatever It Takes". This was followed by a fourth
                studio album "Origins" in 2018, featuring the single "Natural" which became their fifth song to top 
                the Hot Rock Songs chart. They released their fifth studio album "Mercury - Act 1" on September 3,
                2021 and its follow up "Mercury - Act 2" on July 1, 2022.

                <h3 style="text-align: center">Awards</h3>
                Imagine Dragons has won three American Music Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, one Grammy Award, 
                one MTV Video Music Award, and one World Music Award. In May 2014, the band was nominated for 14 
                Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes 
                innovation and creativity of artists across different genres. In April 2018, the band was nominated 
                11 more times for Billboard Music Awards. Imagine Dragons has sold more than 75 million records 
                worldwide, making them one of the world's best-selling music artists. They were the most streamed 
                group of 2018 on Spotify and are the first rock act to have four songs, "Radioactive", "Demons", 
                "Believer", and "Thunder", to surpass one billion streams each. According to Billboard, "Believer", 
                "Thunder", and "Radioactive" were the three best performing rock songs of the 2010s.

                <h3 style="text-align: center">About</h3>
                Daniel Coulter Reynolds (born July 14, 1987) is an American singer, songwriter, and record 
                producer. He is the lead vocalist of the pop rock band Imagine Dragons. He was born in Las
                Vegas, the seventh of nine children of Christine M. and Ronald Reynolds. He is a fourth
                generation Nevadian. Following his graduation in high school, he attended University of Nevada,
                Las Vegas and then transferred to Brigham Young University after serving an LDS mission where he
                studied communications, marketing and music and excelled academically. While at BYU, he formed 
                Imagine Dragons and won the school's battle of the bands competition before leaving to pursue 
                music full-time.

                <h3 style="text-align:center">Career</h3>
                Reynolds was initially reluctant to become a professional musician as his future bandmate Wayne
                Sermon had once told him: "Don't do music because you want to do music - do music if you have to
                do music". After he began attending Brigham Young University, he realised that he could not do 
                anything else and committed fully to a professional music Career. In Utah, he met and recruited
                drummer Andrew Tolman to form Imagine Dragons.

                <h3 style="text-align:center">About</h3>
                Daniel Wayne Sermon (born June 15, 1984) is an American musician, songwriter, and record producer. 
                He is the lead guitarist for the pop rock band Imagine Dragons. He was born in American Fork, Utah
                to parents Jeff and Debbie Sermon. He is one of the five children. As a youth, he learnt to play both
                cello and guitar and was determined to be a guitarist even as a child. His father had an audio-phile
                quality amplifier, a record player, and all of The Beatles albums on Vinyl which Sermon enjoyed
                listening to. He also loved the sounds of Tom Scholz (of Boston) and his approach to solos.
                He attended Berklee College of Music where he double majored in guitar performance and composition, 
                graduating in 2008. While at Berklee he was part of a five-guitar jazz fusion ensemble called The 
                Eclectic Electrics. Sermon has chronic insomnia and will often record songs during the middle of 
                the night, sleeping only a couple of hours a day.

                <h3 style="text-align:center">Career</h3>
                Wayne Sermon first met Dan Reynolds after hearing him perform at a club in Utah and approaching him 
                afterwards about his musical interests. Reynolds invited him to join his band and move to Las Vegas.
                Sermon then invited Ben McKee to join the band on bass, and drummer Daniel Platzman, also a friend 
                of Wayne's from Berklee College of Music, became the last member to join the group at the invitation 
                of McKee.
